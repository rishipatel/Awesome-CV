 I have 6+ years of experience in C++ developing libraries on unix platform, using templates and couting heavily on OO design, generic programming, traits and design pattern.
 I have been involved in all phases of software development right from the designing, writing, testing, continuous delivery, deployment planning and monitoring the software in production.
 I have some experience in functional programming through clojure and have worked on an application involving use of hot technologies like react and graphql.
